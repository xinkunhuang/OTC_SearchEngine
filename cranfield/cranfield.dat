Garcinia cambogia is an extract obtained from the dried fruit of the Garcinia cambogia (GC) tree, a native plant species of South India and South Asia.1,2 The fruit looks like a small green pumpkin, and is used extensively in Asian-style cooking for its sour flavor.The skin, or rind of Garcinia cambogia fruit contains large amounts of hydroxycitric acid (HCA). HCA is a derivative of citric acid, and is marketed as a weight loss supplement, either alone or in combination with other supplements.1,2How HCA works to promote weight loss is not precisely known, but several theories exist. Some experts believe it works by inhibiting an enzyme called citrate lyase, interfering with the conversion of unused carbohydrates into fat. Although HCA does have this effect on carbohydrates in a laboratory petri dish, it is unproven whether it does this once inside the body.1,2Other experts suggest HCA affects other enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, such as pancreatic alpha amylase and intestinal alpha glucosidase. A few postulate that it increases the release or availability of serotonin in the brain, promoting appetite suppression.1,2 Nobody knows for sure just how HCA worksâ€¦ or if it really does work.

MegaKrill is a form of krill oil that claims to be more potent or purer than regular krill oil. However, because supplements are unregulated, there is no guarantee that this holds true for all brands of MegaKrill. Krill oil is extracted mainly from Antarctic krill, specifically a species called Euphausia superba. Krill are small shrimp-like crustaceans which represent an important dietary link in the global food chain, being the main staple of hundreds of different animals, including fish, birds, and whales. Harvesting of krill oil is not without controversy and studies have suggested Antarctic krill stocks have fallen by 80% since 1970, which is a serious cause for concern. MegaKrill is a source of EPA and DHA omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but at a different ratio than fish oil. Krill oil has a ratio of 2:1 EPA to DHA, whereas fish oil has a ratio of 1:1 EPA to DHA. EPA is more effective than DHA at reducing cellular inflammation, and the more EPA in the diet, the less arachidonic acid there is available to produce proinflammatory cytokines such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.Unlike omega-3â€™s found in fish oil which are bound to triglycerides, the omega-3â€™s in krill oil are bound to phospholipids, which reportedly improve absorption by 30 to 100%. Research has not yet determined if this conveys more health effects. However, more effective absorption does appear to reduce the incidence of side effects such as a fishy after taste or fishy burps, a common complaint with fish oils.Krill oil also contains astaxanthin, a brightly colored carotenoid (a pigment that conveys color) that occurs naturally in algae, shrimp, lobster, crab, wild salmon, and krill. Astaxanthin provides an interface between water and fats and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties; although there have been few high-quality trials to test its benefits in people. Because it is so deeply colored, astaxanthin can make testing for contaminants or spoilage in krill oil difficult.
Melatonin is the natural hormone your body secretes that helps to maintain your wake-sleep cycle (also called â€œbiological clockâ€). The wake-sleep cycle is the process of sleep and wakefulness; in humans this averages 8 hours of nighttime sleep and 16 hours of daytime activity. Melatonin is also made synthetically and available without a prescription as an over-the-counter (OTC) dietary supplement in the U.S.Endogenous melatonin release (made by our bodies) is increased each day in response to darkness, peaking between 11PM and 3AM at roughly 200 picograms (pg) per mL. Nighttime levels are roughly 10 times higher than in the daytime. Levels fall sharply before daylight, and are barely detectable in the daylight hours. The rise and fall in endogenous levels signal wake and sleep times, known as our circadian rhythm.Natural secretion starts from the amino acid tryptophan, with serotonin as an intermediary, and then is released to the receptors in the brain, eye and other areas to help control the sleep and wake cycles. The half-life is short, roughly 20 to 50 minutes. It is metabolized (broken down) by the CYP-450 enzyme system in the liver and then excreted in the urine or feces.Shorter periods of production occur in the summer with longer days, and more prolonged periods of production occur in the winter. Light at night (such as from smartphones or the TV) blocks production and can lead to sleep disturbances. Age also suppresses the levels of nighttime melatonin that are released, which may contribute to the problem of insomnia and early awakening often seen in older adults.Melatonin supplementation has been suggested to have many uses, from sleep disorders to cancer treatment , but robust studies are lacking for many uses. However, it has been widely studied for treatment of jet lag and other sleep disorders. Additional, early research to define melatonin suggests it has an anti-oxidative activity, a role in modulating immune responses, and possible anti-tumor activity.

Melatonin is the natural hormone your body secretes that helps to maintain your wake-sleep cycle (also called â€œbiological clockâ€). The wake-sleep cycle is the process of sleep and wakefulness; in humans this averages 8 hours of nighttime sleep and 16 hours of daytime activity. Melatonin is also made synthetically and available without a prescription as an over-the-counter (OTC) dietary supplement in the U.S.Endogenous melatonin release (made by our bodies) is increased each day in response to darkness, peaking between 11PM and 3AM at roughly 200 picograms (pg) per mL. Nighttime levels are roughly 10 times higher than in the daytime. Levels fall sharply before daylight, and are barely detectable in the daylight hours. The rise and fall in endogenous levels signal wake and sleep times, known as our circadian rhythm.Natural secretion starts from the amino acid tryptophan, with serotonin as an intermediary, and then is released to the receptors in the brain, eye and other areas to help control the sleep and wake cycles. The half-life is short, roughly 20 to 50 minutes. It is metabolized (broken down) by the CYP-450 enzyme system in the liver and then excreted in the urine or feces.Shorter periods of production occur in the summer with longer days, and more prolonged periods of production occur in the winter. Light at night (such as from smartphones or the TV) blocks production and can lead to sleep disturbances. Age also suppresses the levels of nighttime melatonin that are released, which may contribute to the problem of insomnia and early awakening often seen in older adults.Melatonin supplementation has been suggested to have many uses, from sleep disorders to cancer treatment , but robust studies are lacking for many uses. However, it has been widely studied for treatment of jet lag and other sleep disorders. Additional, early research to define melatonin suggests it has an anti-oxidative activity, a role in modulating immune responses, and possible anti-tumor activity.

Melatonin is the natural hormone your body secretes that helps to maintain your wake-sleep cycle (also called â€œbiological clockâ€). The wake-sleep cycle is the process of sleep and wakefulness; in humans this averages 8 hours of nighttime sleep and 16 hours of daytime activity. Melatonin is also made synthetically and available without a prescription as an over-the-counter (OTC) dietary supplement in the U.S.Endogenous melatonin release (made by our bodies) is increased each day in response to darkness, peaking between 11PM and 3AM at roughly 200 picograms (pg) per mL. Nighttime levels are roughly 10 times higher than in the daytime. Levels fall sharply before daylight, and are barely detectable in the daylight hours. The rise and fall in endogenous levels signal wake and sleep times, known as our circadian rhythm.Natural secretion starts from the amino acid tryptophan, with serotonin as an intermediary, and then is released to the receptors in the brain, eye and other areas to help control the sleep and wake cycles. The half-life is short, roughly 20 to 50 minutes. It is metabolized (broken down) by the CYP-450 enzyme system in the liver and then excreted in the urine or feces.Shorter periods of production occur in the summer with longer days, and more prolonged periods of production occur in the winter. Light at night (such as from smartphones or the TV) blocks production and can lead to sleep disturbances. Age also suppresses the levels of nighttime melatonin that are released, which may contribute to the problem of insomnia and early awakening often seen in older adults.Melatonin supplementation has been suggested to have many uses, from sleep disorders to cancer treatment , but robust studies are lacking for many uses. However, it has been widely studied for treatment of jet lag and other sleep disorders. Additional, early research to define melatonin suggests it has an anti-oxidative activity, a role in modulating immune responses, and possible anti-tumor activity.

Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil is a brand of krill oil.Krill oil is extracted mainly from Antarctic krill, specifically a species called Euphausia superba. Krill are small shrimp-like crustaceans which represent an important dietary link in the global food chain, being the main staple of hundreds of different animals, including fish, birds, and whales. Harvesting of krill oil is not without controversy and studies have suggested Antarctic krill stocks have fallen by 80% since 1970, which is a serious cause for concern.Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil is a source of EPA and DHA omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but at a different ratio than fish oil. Krill oil has a ratio of 2:1 EPA to DHA, whereas fish oil has a ratio of 1:1 EPA to DHA. EPA is more effective than DHA at reducing cellular inflammation, and the more EPA in the diet, the less arachidonic acid there is available to produce proinflammatory cytokines, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.Unlike omega-3â€™s found in fish oil which are bound to triglycerides, the omega-3â€™s in krill oil are bound to phospholipids, which reportedly improve absorption by 30 to 100%. Research has not yet determined if this conveys more health effects. However, more effective absorption does appear to reduce the incidence of side effects such as a fishy after taste or fishy burps, a common complaint with fish oils.Krill oil also contains astaxanthin, a brightly colored carotenoid (a pigment that conveys color) that occurs naturally in algae, shrimp, lobster, crab, wild salmon, and krill. Astaxanthin provides an interface between water and fats and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties; although there have been few high-quality trials to test its benefits in people.
