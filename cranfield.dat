UNDERSTANDING FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE NASAL SPRAY What Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is, and how it works. What is Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray? Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is an effective, allergy medicine that you can now buy without a prescription. It works directly in the nose to help block your allergic reactions. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray relieves allergy symptoms caused by pollen, mold, dust and pets. What is the active ingredient in Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray? The active ingredient in Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is called fluticasone propionate. Fluticasone propionate is a glucocorticoid – a substance produced naturally by your body to help fight inflammation. It works in your nose to relieve your allergy symptoms. Barely any of it travels through your body. It’s been prescribed by doctors for over 20 years, and used effectively by millions. A glucocorticoid is a kind of steroid that is different from the anabolic (muscle-building) steroids sometimes misused by athletes. In fact, world class athletes are allowed to use glucocorticoids during competition to treat their allergies. Who should not use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray? For complete guidance, check the Drug Facts label on the back of the Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray package. Can I use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray for asthma? No, Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is not a treatment for asthma. Ask your doctor what medicine to take for your asthma. Can I use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray for colds? No, use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray to treat only your allergies – not your cold symptoms. If you’re not sure whether your symptoms come from allergies or a cold, ask your doctor. What happens when you have allergies? Allergies start when allergens like pollen or pet dander enter your body and trigger your immune system to respond. Your body’s natural response is to release multiple inflammatory substances, (also referred to as mediators) that cause your allergy symptoms. How does Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray work? Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray works right in your nose to help block your allergic reaction at the source to relieve the symptoms that make you uncomfortable. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray acts on multiple inflammatory substances, including histamine, prostaglandins, cytokines, tryptases, chemokines and leukotrienes. Most common OTC allergy pills act on histamine alone. Because of the way it works, it may take several days for Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray to reach maximum effect. That’s why it’s best to use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray regularly, once a day. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray not only relieves sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose and itchy, watery eyes, but also relieves nasal congestion.

There is enough medicine in the spray bottle to allow for priming sprays plus the number of sprays labeled on the bottle. Always point the spray bottle away from your face when priming. How long should a bottle of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray last? This table shows roughly how long your bottle will last. It assumes you follow the instructions for priming the pump, and that those age 12 or older use two sprays in each nostril every day while children age 4-11 use one spray in each nostril every day. After you’ve used the number of sprays shown on the label, each spray may not deliver a full dose — even if there is liquid left in the bottle. If the label says… The bottle should last age 12+… The bottle should last age 4-11… 30 sprays 1 week 2 weeks 60 sprays 2 weeks 4 weeks 120 sprays 4 weeks 8 weeks 150 sprays 5 weeks 10 weeks* *Check with a doctor if a child 4-11 needs to use longer than 2 months a year Is Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray OK to use with other medicines? You should tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray. Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray can be used with most non-prescription and prescription medicines. However, there are a few medicines to look out for because they may cause the level of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray in your body to become too high. Just to be safe, check this table to see if you’re taking any of these medicines. If you’re taking… Here’s what to do… Medicines for HIV infection (such as ritonavir) Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray Medicines with glucocorticoids Including some medicines for skin rash such as eczema, asthma, inflammation, allergic reactions, or eye conditions Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray Ketoconazole Pills for fungal infection Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray What are the differences in the way children age 4-11 should use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray? Children age 4-11 should use a lower dose of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray for a shorter period of time. Ages Children 4-11 years of age Users 12 years of age and older Dosage 1 spray in each nostril once daily Up to 2 sprays in each nostril once daily Duration before checking with a doctor Up to 2 months of use a year Up to 6 months of daily use Why is the use of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray for children age 4-11 limited to 2 months a year before checking with a doctor? When used long-term, intranasal glucocorticoids like Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray may cause the growth rate of some children to be slower. Whether this will affect a child’s ultimate height is not known. As a precaution, children should use for the shortest amount of time necessary to achieve symptom relief. Talk to your child’s doctor if your child needs to use the spray for longer than 2 months a year. WHAT TO EXPECT What it’s like to use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray. How soon will I get relief? You may start to feel relief the first day you use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray. Keep using it every day, though. It takes several days before Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray builds up to full effectiveness. How long will the relief last? Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is meant to control your symptoms every day, all day and all night. To help you get this lasting relief, it’s important to use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray regularly, once a day. Does Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray cause a “rebound” effect? No, Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray does not cause a rebound effect. Some nasal decongestant sprays may cause your nasal passages to swell up even more when you use them too often or for longer than their label says you should (three days). This is sometimes called a “rebound effect.” Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is a different kind of medicine and does not cause any rebound effect. You can use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray for up to six months if you are age 12 or older or up to two months a year if you are age 4-11 before checking with a doctor. Will Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray make me drowsy? No, Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray does not cause drowsiness. Some allergy medications can cause drowsiness, but Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray does not. Why does Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray have a smell? The light floral scent you may notice comes from one of the important ingredients in the Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray formula. No fragrance is added to Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray. What if little or nothing is spraying out? Try priming the spray bottle. It may take a few pumps to get the dispenser spraying again. If that doesn’t work, the spray nozzle may be clogged. You can clean it following the directions in the Quick Start Guide on the other side. What if I feel stinging in my nose, or I sneeze? Some people may feel a slight stinging, or may sneeze, after spraying Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray in their nostrils. This feeling should go away in a few seconds. What if I feel or taste the medicine in my throat? Generally, you can avoid this by taking a shallower breath next time you spray Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray into your nostrils. For example, take the kind of breath you would use to smell a flower. What if I have chicken pox, measles or tuberculosis or come into contact with someone who does? Stop using Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray and ask your doctor. What if I’m having severe sinus pain? If you feel severe pain in your face, have thick nasal discharge, or think you may have a sinus infection, stop using Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray and see your doctor. Your doctor may want to consider if other medicines are needed. What if my symptoms aren’t better after one week? If you have used Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray for a week and your allergy symptoms are not getting better, stop use and ask your doctor. You may have an infection. Does Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray have side effects? Serious side effects are rare with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray because Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray works in your nose, and barely any of it travels through your body. However, like all medicines, Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray can cause side effects in some people. Here are some side effects that have been reported when using Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray. If you have any concerns about side effects, talk with your doctor.

Pumped six times and still no mist? Spray nozzle may be clogged. See KEEP IT CLEAN . Blow nose gently to clear nostrils. Close one nostril and put tip of spray nozzle in other nostril.
